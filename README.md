## Prerequisites

- Install python 3.6.5
- Ask an access token to your SDMC administrator

## How to export User?
Sample is defined in sample-export-users folder.
### Configuration
You have to edit config.js and copy your access token on it.
```
{
    "token": "SDMC access token"
}
```
### Launch
Command to execute example is:
```
    python exportUser.py --config=config.json
```
At the end, a successfully message is logged and you can open the file ```UserData.csv``` which contains all users informations.

Default user informations are :
```
id;first_name;last_name;email;state;roles;devices_count;last_activity_date;register_date.
```

### Options
- You can change SMDC url by defining ```serverUrl``` in config.json
- You can filter user columns you want to retrieve by defining ```exposedData``` in config.json.
This atttribute is an array which is a subassembly of Default user informations.

 For example, if you want id and email you have to add :
 ```
 "exposedData": ["id", "email"]
  ```
